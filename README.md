# ScreenInvader.js

...is a collection of utility functions to interact with
[Janosh](https://github.com/kallaballa/Janosh) and
[ScreenInvader](http://github.com/screeninvader/screeninvader) over
their WebSocket API. The goal is to create a somewhat stable and
maintainable base for different ScreenInvader clients.
